//// Monad instances: Writer, Reader.

/// Encapsulates a pair whose first component is a `value` of arbitrary type a and the second component is a `string`. \
/// Used to `embellish` the return values of functions.
/// ### Examples
/// ```gleam
/// // Original function
/// f = fn(x) {x * 2}
/// // Embellished function
/// f = fn(x) {Writer(x * 2, "doubled ")}
/// ```
pub type Writer(a) {

/// The `identity morphism` for the Writer category.
/// ### Examples
/// ```gleam
/// writer_return(2)
/// // -> Writer(2, "")
/// writer_return("abcd")
/// // -> Writer("abcd", "") 
/// ```

/// ### Examples
